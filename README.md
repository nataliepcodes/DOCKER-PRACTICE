# DOCKER-PRACTICE üê≥

This repository aims to collect various useful resources about Docker. So that I can review these and apply them in practice. \
Starting point/baseline on 14/4/2024: Docker is still a mystery to me. Had an opportunity to learn about it last year through a study group exercise, although it was not successful. Eager to try again. \
Goals: Learn more about it. Try it again - and make it work, this time :)
